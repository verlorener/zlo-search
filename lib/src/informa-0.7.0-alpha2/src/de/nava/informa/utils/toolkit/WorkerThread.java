/**
 * Abstract worker thread which is driven by <code>WorkersManager</code>. Worker thread runs
 * until <code>terminate</code> property is set to true. All of the threads are run in
 * daemon mode and do not prevent application from sudden quit.
 * <p>
 * In order to do something useful with channel this class should be extended with implementation
 * of <code>process()</code> method. This method is invoked each time the thread receives new
 * processing task. Current class takes care of getting new tasks, marking busy state and
 * other necessary tasks.</p>
 * <p>
 * After the task is finished worker checks <code>JobSourceIF</code> object (if specified)
 * to get new assignments and it there's no job goes to sleep for a <code>IDLE_SLEEP_TIME</code>
 * milliseconds. When manager finds new task it immediately awakens the thread. If the thread
 * doesn't receive new assignments for an <code>IDLE_SLEEP_TIME</code> it checks the
 * <code>JobSourceIF</code> object again by itself to find new task. This is done for greater
 * safety reasons to avoid situations when the queue is full of tasks and workers are in endless
 * sleep.
