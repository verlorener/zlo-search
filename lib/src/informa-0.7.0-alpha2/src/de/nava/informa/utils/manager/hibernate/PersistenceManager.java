/**
 * Hibernate Persistence Manager. This manager talks to Hibernate to store / restore
 * persistence data. Manager is multi-thread safe. It follows the rule of identities and
 * multiple calls to getting methods (for example, <code>getGroups()</code>) return
 * the same instances of objects. This makes life of developers and client applications
 * easier.
 * <p>
 * It's not enough to directly update the fields of objects in order to have the same
 * fields updated persistently. You should explicitly call <code>updateXXXX()</code>
 * methods to transfer changes to the storage. The decision to make explicit updates
 * based on the fact that automatic flushing changes to database each time the value
 * of some property changes will take too much resources when many properties are
 * updated in a single block of code.</p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note that the manager itself does no efforts to initialize Hibernate!</b><br>
 * It uses system properties as overrides of normal Hibernate inialization ways, like
 * <code>hibernate.properties</code> and <code>hibernate.cfg.xml</code> files which
 * are loaded when this manager requires Hibernate services for the first time. Please,
 * read Hibernate documentation to learn what files and where should be placed
 * to initialize the product properly.</p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Please also note, that this implementation requires to be the only source of
 * changes to Hibernate data storage (database or something else) to operate normally!</b>
 * Basically it is not a problem at all, but if you find that it's not your case, please
 * let us know.
 * </p>
